## Page Proposal
The proposal utilized data from the Global Food Security Index to examine how climate change affected food security indices across different countries. The collection included information on resilience, natural resources, food supply, cost, quality, and safety, covering 113 countries.

## Problem Description
The study investigated the relationship between various nations' food security indices and climate change indicators. It aimed to highlight the advantages and disadvantages that different countries faced in maintaining food security amidst shifting weather patterns. The study evaluated how climate change affected food security in different countries, with the research question being, "How did climate change affect the food security index of different countries?"

## Data Description
- **Dataset**: Global Food Security Index covering 113 countries.
- **Link**: [Global Food Security Index](https://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/)
- **Variables**: 
  - **Resilience**: Evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess system stability.
  - **Natural Resources**: Quantitative analysis was used to evaluate the sustainability of resources.
  - **Food Supply, Cost, Quality, and Safety**: These factors were considered using both qualitative and quantitative metrics, including safety ratings and nutrient content. Affordability and availability were assessed through quantitative measures.

## Methods Used
1. **Multiple Regression Analysis**: This technique was employed to investigate the correlation between the food security index (dependent variable) and climate change indicators (independent variables). Multiple regression analysis helped identify the relative significance of various climate change factors on food security.
2. **Linear Regression Analysis**: Linear regression was used to model the association between specific climate change indicators and particular components of the food security index, such as food affordability or availability.
3. **Logistic Regression Analysis**: If any components of the food security index were categorical (e.g., food safety ratings), logistic regression was used to model the association between climate change indicators and these categorical outcomes.
4. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: ANOVA was applied to compare the mean food security index or its components across several groups of countries based on their susceptibility to climate change or other relevant characteristics.
5. **Cluster Analysis**: Clustering techniques were used to identify patterns or links by grouping countries according to their climate change and food security indices.
6. **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the degree and direction of the association between the food security index and climate change indicators.

## Conclusion
The proposed study aimed to enhance understanding of the complex interactions between global food security and climate change. A multi-method approach was used to uncover subtle insights into how climate change impacted food security outcomes in different countries. Ultimately, the findings from this research project informed evidence-based policy actions and initiatives to ensure sustainable food systems and foster resilience in the face of climate change challenges.
